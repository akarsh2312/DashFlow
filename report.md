# Report on Component Structure and State Management Choices

## Component Structure

The project is structured in a way that promotes modularity and reusability. The main components are organized under the `components` directory, and the state management logic is encapsulated within the `store` directory. Here is a breakdown of the key components and their roles:

- **App.tsx**: This is the main application component that sets up the Redux provider, Chakra UI provider, and React Router. It defines the main routes and the navigation structure.

- **Counter.tsx**: A component that displays a counter with increment, decrement, and reset functionalities. It uses Redux for state management and `react-spring` for animations.

- **Dashboard.tsx**: A dashboard component that displays user statistics and trends using `recharts` for data visualization. It also uses `react-spring` for animations.

- **Login.tsx**: A login form component that handles user authentication. It uses Redux to dispatch login actions and Chakra UI for styling.

- **PrivateRoute.tsx**: A higher-order component that protects routes from unauthorized access. It checks the authentication state from Redux and redirects to the login page if the user is not authenticated.

- **RichTextEditor.tsx**: A rich text editor component built with `tiptap` and Chakra UI. It provides formatting options like bold, italic, underline, and bullet lists.

- **UserForm.tsx**: A form component for adding user data. It uses Redux to dispatch actions for adding users and Chakra UI for styling.

## State Management Choices

The project uses Redux Toolkit for state management, which simplifies the process of writing Redux logic and provides a more efficient and scalable way to manage the application state. Here are the key aspects of the state management choices:

- **Slices**: The state is divided into slices, each representing a specific part of the state. The slices are defined in the `store` directory:
  - **authSlice.ts**: Manages authentication state, including login and logout actions.
  - **counterSlice.ts**: Manages the counter state with actions for incrementing, decrementing, and resetting the counter.
  - **userSlice.ts**: Manages user data, including actions for adding users.

- **Store Configuration**: The Redux store is configured in `index.ts`. It combines the reducers from different slices and sets up the store using `configureStore` from Redux Toolkit.

- **Selectors and Dispatch**: Components use `useSelector` to access the state and `useDispatch` to dispatch actions. This is evident in components like `Counter.tsx`, `Dashboard.tsx`, and `Login.tsx`.

- **Local Storage**: The `userSlice.ts` uses local storage to persist user data across sessions. This ensures that user data is not lost when the page is refreshed.
